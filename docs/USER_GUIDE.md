## 🔗 Event Connections

Navigate to **Connections** in the top menu.

### Understanding Connections

The AI identifies three types of relationships:

1. **Causes**: Event A directly leads to Event B
   - Example: "Red Sea attacks → shipping delays → material costs ↑"

2. **Relates To**: Events share common factors
   - Example: "Taiwan tensions + SE Asia flooding → Asian manufacturing disruption"

3. **Follows**: Sequential relationship
   - Example: "Sanctions → trade shifts → price spikes"

### Reading Connection Cards

Each card shows:
- **Relationship Type**: How events connect
- **Confidence Score**: AI certainty (0-100%)
- **Event A**: First event (click to view)
- **Event B**: Second event (click to view)
- **Explanation**: Why they're connected

### Strategic Value

Connections help you:
- **Predict cascading effects** (supply chain knock-on impacts)
- **Identify leading indicators** (early warning signs)
- **Understand market dynamics** (cause-effect relationships)
- **Plan contingencies** (if A happens, expect B)

### Example Analysis:

**Connection:** EU tariffs on Chinese steel → Australia-India trade deal

**Insight:** EU restrictions create opportunity for Australian suppliers to fill gap via new India trade route.

**Action:** Contact Australian steel exporters, negotiate pricing before demand spike.
